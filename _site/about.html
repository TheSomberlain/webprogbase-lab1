          <p>Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.

                Tablature is common for fretted stringed instruments such as the lute, vihuela, or guitar, as well as many free reed aerophones such as the harmonica. Tablature was common during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, and is commonly used today in notating many forms of music.
                
                Three types of organ tablature were used in Europe: German, Spanish and Italian.[1]
                
                To distinguish standard musical notation from tablature, the former is usually called "staff notation" or just "notation". </p>
            <p><p>A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches consisting of two or more (usually three or more) notes (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding simultaneously.[1][2] (For many practical and theoretical purposes, arpeggios and broken chords, or sequences of chord tones, may also be considered as chords.) </p></p>
