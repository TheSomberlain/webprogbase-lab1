        <h3>Short Bio</h3>
    <p>Jon Andreas Nödtveidt (28 June 1975 – 13 August 2006)[1] was a Swedish musician. Best known as the lead guitarist and vocalist of the Swedish black metal band Dissection, he co-founded the band in 1989 with bassist Peter Palmdahl.

            Nödtveidt also performed in several other projects, including The Black (as Rietas), De Infernali, Nifelheim, Ophthalamia (as Shadow), Satanized, Siren's Yell, and Terror, a grindcore band which featured members of At the Gates.
            
            He also worked as a journalist in Metal Zone, where he was responsible for keeping track of the growing black metal scene. He was a member of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, now known as Temple of the Black Light, and the Werewolf Legion, a Swedish gang (not to be confused with the Russian Werewolf Legion). Contrary to popular belief, he was not its co-creator, but "was introduced [...] by close friends at a quite early stage."[2]
            
            Nödtveidt was convicted of being an accessory to the 1997 murder of Josef ben Meddour,[3] an Algerian gay[4] man. He restarted Dissection upon his release from prison in 2004. </p>
